            <h3>Problem Solver and Traveller</h3>
            <p>I very much love to solve programming problems. Still I am a beginner problem solver & continuously
                learning new techniques. I solve programming problems with various languages like C, C++ and Python.
                You can visit my codeforces profile. My codeforces handle is <strong>Z4YED</strong>.</p>
            <p>I love exploring new places. Recenly I have travelled in Cox's Bazar. It's one of the best tourist spot
                in Bangladesh and it is the largest beach in the world. I visited there with my friends & enjoyed a lot.

            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>A Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
            <p>A few days ago, my center of interests was in BackEnd Development. I have learned the Basics of Django
                Framework. All of my projects are available in my GitHub account. Meanwhile, I have learned the basic of
                Javascript. Then I have decided to continue my learning with MERN stack. </p>

            <p>My initial goal is the learn the html, css and javascipt basics. After that I will try to learn MongoDB,
                ExpressJS, React and Node. I hope this is going to be a tremendous journey for myself. </p> <br>
